  It can serve as a reference implementation of current best practices in the project (mirroring the [DEEP template](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4-template)).

  This demo module implements:
  * **dummy inference**, ie. we return the same inputs we are fed. If some input is not fed we generate a default one.
  * **dummy training**, ie. we sleep for some time and output some random monitoring metrics.

  The two branches in this repo cover the two main usecases:
  * `master`: this is a reference implementation on how to return a JSON response for predict().
  * `return-files`: this is a reference implementation on how to return non-JSON responses for predict().

  This is particularly useful when returning:
  - long responses (that could better fit better in a txt file),
  - media files (eg. returning an image),
  - multiple files (for example returning an image and a text file at the same time, packing them into a zip file).
